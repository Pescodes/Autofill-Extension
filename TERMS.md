# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** February 20, 2026

Welcome to **Alt+P Autofill**. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Alt+P Autofill browser extension (the "Extension"). By installing or using the Extension, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

---

### 1. License and Usage
* **Grant of License:** We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Extension for your personal or professional use.
* **Open Source:** This project is currently licensed under the **MIT License**. You may view, modify, and distribute the source code in accordance with the terms of that license.
* **Restrictions:** You may not use the Extension for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, nor may you use it to circumvent the security of any website.

### 2. Nature of Service
* **Functionality:** Alt+P Autofill provides an automated method to fill web forms and social media handles using data you provide within the extension popup.
* **Local Processing:** The Extension operates locally within your browser. It does not provide an account-based service or cloud synchronization.

### 3. Payments and Licensing (Paddle)
* **Merchant of Record:** All payments are processed through **Paddle**, our Merchant of Record.
* **Payment Terms:** By purchasing a license, you agree to Paddle's checkout terms and conditions.
* **Refunds:** Because the Extension is a digital product that can be tested via the open-source repository or trial, refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis through our support email, subject to Paddle’s refund policies.

### 4. Data Storage and Responsibility
* **User Data:** You acknowledge that all profile data (names, emails, social handles) is stored in your browser's `sync` storage. 
* **Security:** While we use standard browser storage APIs, you are responsible for the security of your device. We are not liable for data loss resulting from browser corruption, uninstallation, or unauthorized access to your computer.
* **Data Deletion:** Uninstalling the Extension or using the "Clear" button within the popup will permanently delete all locally stored data.

### 5. Limitation of Liability
* **"As-Is" Basis:** The Extension is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the Extension will work on every website, as web form structures frequently change.
* **No Liability:** In no event shall the developers be liable for any damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Extension, including but not limited to incorrect data entry or form submission errors.

### 6. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Any changes will be posted within this GitHub repository and updated in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
